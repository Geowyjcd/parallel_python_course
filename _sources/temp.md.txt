# First step: Installing python dependencies

* All the code used in the tutorial can be run on a Windows, Mac, or Linux laptop

* Please do the following prior to the tutorial:

  * Download and install https://conda.io/miniconda.html on your laptop, accepting all
    the defaults for the install (I specified an install into a folder named ma36 below):
  
  * If you are running on Windows:
    * Press the &#8862; Win key to open a cmd shell and type:
           anaconda prompt
      
      This should launch a cmd shell that we can use to install other packages
      
      To test your installation, type 
      
            conda list
            
      at the prompt, which should show you a list of installed packages starting with:
      
            (base) C:\Users\paust>conda list
            # packages in environment at C:\Users\paust\ma36:  
      
    * If you are running MacOS or Linux, after the install launch a bash shell, hopefully
      when you type:

            conda list

      you will see output that looks like:


            % conda list
            # packages in environment at /Users/phil/mb36:
            #
            # Name                    Version                   Build  Channel
